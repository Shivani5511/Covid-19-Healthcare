						<h4 style="color: #152c59;">Symptoms of coronavirus:</h4>
						<p>When anyone is affected by this virus, it doesn't make you
							sudden sick. But if your immune system is healthy, then our
							efforts is to get rid of this. If your immunity is high, then
							there are fewer chances to get affected by the virus. For
							example, our immune system raises our body temperature to make it
							hotter to kill these viruses. Everyone's body is different, so
							the symptoms are caused by our immune system, not by the virus
							itself. Different people have different symptoms when they are
							affected by the same infection or illness. Novel coronavirus
							(Covid-19) is an illness of respiratory, and it affects the parts
							of our body that helps us to breathe: mainly our throat, nose,
							and lungs. In more severe cases, the infection cause pneumonia,
							severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), kidney failure, and
							death. If you are affected with novel coronavirus, the symptoms
							may include: Coughing/sneezing High Fever Sore throat Fatigue
							Shortness of breath/ difficulty in breathing Muscle pain/
							tiredness</p>

				<h4 style="color: #152c59;">How does the coronavirus (COVID-19)
					spread, and how can we observe it?</h4>
				<p>Coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading between people to people
					when a sick person coughs or sneezes in front of others. The
					coronavirus can impact us if any affected person sneezes or coughs
					on other people or things. The virus can also harm us if the
					infected person have coughed or sneezed on a surface (like a door
					handle, balcony grill), and we touch the particular surface or the
					person's hand. The droplets of the infected person infects our
					hands and the viruses is transferred through our nose, eyes, or
					mouth into our body.</p>

				<h4 style="color: #152c59;">How can we cure ourselves of
					COVID-19?</h4>
				<p>Washing your hands often and correctly prevent us from the
					viruses from entering the body. Six steps to wash hands properly
					with an alcohol-based solution:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Rub hands palm to palm.</li>
					<li>Rub hands with fingers interlaced.</li>
					<li>Rub the tips of fingers in the palm of the opposite hand
						in a circular motion.</li>
					<li>Clean thumb by holding it on the other hand, and rotate
						it.</li>
					<li>Interlock fingers and rub the back of fingers on opposite
						palms.</li>
					<li>Then rinse hands with water.</li>
				</ul>

				Washing our hands correctly is one of the best things we do to
				protect ourselves from coronavirus. Try to stay away for at least
				1.5 meters from the particular infected person who is coughing or
				sneezing. Even if they do not have the infection of coronavirus
				(COVID-19), they can transfer germs. So be careful all the time, and
				social distancing is also a type to prevent us from COVID-19. We
				have to follow these rules for social distancing: <br>
				<ul>
					<li>Stay home as much as possible.</li>
					<li>Keep 5 meters distancing from others.</li>
					<li>Avoid handshaking, kissing, or hugging to others.</li>
					<li>Work from home and avoid outing.</li>
					<li>Avoid gatherings and crowded places.</li>
					<li>Avoid touching nose, mouth, and eyes frequently.</li>
				</ul>
