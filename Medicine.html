										this recipe,</span> milk is boiled with organic turmeric powder. You
									can also add a pinch of powdered black pepper to increase the
									potency of the drink.To make it sweet, I have added honey, but
									you can go for sugar too.<br> Turmeric Golden Milk or
									Haldi Wala Doodh has some magical power to it which cures all
									your miseries, be it physical or emotional.
